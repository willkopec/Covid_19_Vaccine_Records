    <h1>The idea for this project is to create a database to keep track of Covid-19 records. The table will contain the patient’s basic information (i.d. Name, date of birth, address, etc.), along with vaccination type, dates, lot number, vaccination site, and type of booster. The purpose of this is to provide a centralized system where someone can access everyone’s vaccination information. The database can add patients, remove patients, and update their information. Types of systems that can use this could be a doctor’s office or hospital, pharmacies that are offering the vaccine, and possibly for company hiring purposes, for proof of vaccination. Rather than having people carry around their CDC cards, they can simply pull up the database on their phones and show proof of vaccination. There are a few systems out there that have this type of information, but much of it is not open to public use. Our system, allows for public use, with unique identifiers and security to protect patient privacy (i.e. login system, 2FA).</h1>
